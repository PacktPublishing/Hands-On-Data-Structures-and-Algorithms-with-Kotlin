This is the code repository for [Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms with Kotlin](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-data-structures-and-algorithms-kotlin?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788994019 ), published by Packt.

**Level up your programming skills by understanding how Kotlin's data structure works**

## What is this book about?
Data Structures and Algorithms are much more than theoretical concepts. Learning them gives you an ability to understand computational complexity, solve problems, and write efficient code. Kotlin Data structures and Algorithms enables you to write code that runs faster which is hugely important in web and mobile world. This book takes you through a pragmatic approach with techniques and real-world examples that you can use in your regular production environment.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the basic principles of algorithms, data structures, and measurement of complexity. 
* Find out what general purpose data structures are, including arrays, linked lists, double ended linked lists, and so on. 
* Get a grasp on the basics of abstract data types—stack, queue, and double ended queue. 
* See how to use recursive functions and immutability while understanding and in terms of recursion. 
* Handle reactive programming and its related data structures. 
* Use binary search, sorting, and efficient sorting—quicksort and merge sort. 
* Work with the important concept of trees and list all nodes of the tree, traversal of tree, search trees, and balanced search trees. 
* Gain a better understanding of the concept of graphs, directed and undirected graphs, undirected trees, and much more.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
val x = 10
val y = x * 2
for (i in 0..y) {
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
    println(“$i is Even”)
  } else {
        println(“$i is Odd”)
  }
}
```
